🧠 Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn for a telecom company and building predictive models to identify customers at risk of leaving.
The goal is to generate meaningful insights and recommendations to improve customer retention.

🧩 Task 1: Data Preparation

Description:
Load and explore the dataset.
Handle missing values and encode categorical variables.
Split data into training and testing sets for further analysis.
Skills: Data preprocessing, handling missing values, encoding, data splitting.

📊 Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Description:
Calculate and visualize the overall churn rate.
Analyze customer distribution by gender, partner, and dependent status.
Study tenure distribution and its relation to churn.
Examine churn across contract types and payment methods.
Skills: Data visualization, statistical analysis, EDA.

👥 Task 3: Customer Segmentation

Description:
Segment customers based on tenure, monthly charges, and contract type.
Analyze churn percentage within each cluster.
Identify high-value customers at high churn risk.
Skills: Segmentation, churn analysis, customer behavior insights.

🤖 Task 4: Churn Prediction Model

Description:
Build machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
Train and evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Optimize model performance with feature selection and hyperparameter tuning.
Skills: Machine learning, model training, evaluation metrics, hyperparameter tuning.

📈 Task 5: Model Evaluation and Interpretation

Description:
Evaluate the best-performing model using the test dataset.
Interpret feature importance to understand key churn drivers.
Generate ROC curve and compute AUC for model performance.
Skills: Model evaluation, interpretation, ROC–AUC analysis.
